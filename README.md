# *Care Club For Men*

## Description

- Our passion is to offer resources and methods to young, and older men alike, for their mental health and wellbeing. 

- We built this as growing up most young men dont understand their emotions, and for the most part are taught to "grow up", or "be a man".

- This hopefully solves issues related to a forgotten about part of most mens life. 

- In doing this project we learned a lot about ourselves, as well as ways to handle it.
